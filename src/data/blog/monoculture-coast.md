## The Hidden Geography of Reported Ancestry

Most of America is a demographic stew, where Irish mixes with German, Italian blends with Polish, and Swedish mingles with Norwegian in the great melting pot of ancestry reporting. But scattered across the continental United States are remarkable exceptions—counties where a single reported ancestry dominates so completely that they represent living monuments to specific waves of immigration and settlement.

These "ancestry enclaves" challenge our assumptions about American diversity. While the national narrative celebrates our multicultural heritage, these places tell a different story: one of ancestral concentration so intense that 67.9% of residents in one county claim the same ancestral origin. They are the demographic fossils of America's immigration history, preserved in small communities that maintained strong connections to their heritage.

### A Note on Methodology: Ancestry vs. Race/Ethnicity

This analysis focuses specifically on **reported ancestry** using Census table B04006, which captures how Americans identify their ancestral heritage. This differs from race and ethnicity data in important ways:

- **Major population groups like Mexican, Chinese, Korean, etc. are captured through dedicated Hispanic origin and race questions**, not the ancestry question
- **Ancestry reporting reflects cultural heritage identification** rather than demographic categories
- **This lens reveals "heritage communities"** where people maintain strong connections to specific ancestral origins

The absence of groups like Mexican or Chinese from our findings doesn't indicate their lack of geographic concentration—it reflects how the Census categorizes different types of identity. Our analysis captures the landscape of ancestral heritage reporting, showing where Americans most strongly identify with specific ancestral origins passed down through generations.

The map reveals a striking pattern: America's monoculture enclaves are not randomly distributed but cluster in specific regions where historical settlement patterns, economic opportunities, and cultural preservation intersected to create lasting demographic monuments.

## The Champions of Cultural Concentration

| County | Dominant Ancestry | Percentage | Count |
|--------|------------------|------------|-------|
| McIntosh County, North Dakota | German | 67.9% | 1,884 |
| Smith County, Mississippi | American | 64.8% | 10,440 |
| Griggs County, North Dakota | Norwegian | 62.7% | 1,443 |
| Sioux County, Iowa | English | 59.1% | 13,644 |
| Lavaca County, Texas | Danish | 56.8% | 11,282 |
| Camas County, Idaho | Basque | 55.7% | 579 |
| Bristol County, Massachusetts | Portuguese | 54.3% | 299,076 |
| Richmond County, New York | Italian | 53.9% | 254,534 |
| Pembina County, North Dakota | Norwegian | 53.6% | 3,685 |
| Vernon County, Wisconsin | Norwegian | 52.8% | 15,754 |
| Story County, Nevada | Basque | 52.6% | 2,147 |
| Steele County, North Dakota | Norwegian | 52.5% | 1,026 |
| Garfield County, Montana | Norwegian | 51.8% | 607 |
| Clay County, Minnesota | Norwegian | 51.4% | 3,085 |
| Keya Paha County, Nebraska | Czech | 51.0% | 463 |

*America's Top 15 Most Concentrated Reported Ancestry Enclaves*

The champions list reads like a catalog of American immigration history frozen in time. **McIntosh County, North Dakota** stands as the ultimate monoculture, where 67.9% of residents claim German ancestry—a concentration that makes perfect historical sense for North Dakota's agricultural settlement patterns.

**Smith County, Mississippi** follows with 64.8% "American" ancestry, representing people who identify with generic American heritage rather than specific European origins. **Griggs County, North Dakota** shows 62.7% Norwegian ancestry, while **Sioux County, Iowa** has 59.1% English concentration. These patterns reveal how different regions attracted and retained specific cultural groups through agricultural opportunities, industrial employment, and chain migration.

What's particularly striking is the geographic diversity of these enclaves. The pattern spans from **Lavaca County, Texas** (with 56.8% Danish ancestry) to **Bristol County, Massachusetts** (with 54.3% Portuguese). These aren't just Midwestern farming communities—they represent concentrated settlement patterns that emerged wherever specific industries, religious communities, or cultural institutions created critical mass for particular groups.

## The Geography of Cultural Persistence

| Region | Monoculture Counties |
|--------|---------------------|
| Upper Midwest | 8 |
| Northeast | 4 |
| Plains | 4 |
| Mountain West | 3 |
| Other | 7 |

*Regional distribution of ancestry enclaves*

The regional clustering reveals two distinct patterns of cultural concentration. The **Upper Midwest** and **Northeast** dominate, but for different reasons. The Upper Midwest pattern reflects agricultural settlement—land-grant policies and farming opportunities that drew specific European groups to particular areas where they could maintain cultural cohesion while building agricultural communities.

The Northeast pattern tells a different story: industrial and urban concentration where specific ancestry groups clustered around employment opportunities, creating ethnic neighborhoods that eventually became county-level majorities. **Bristol County's** Portuguese concentration likely reflects industrial employment and fishing industries, while **Richmond County's** Italian dominance reflects the well-known Italian-American community on Staten Island.

What's fascinating is what's missing from this list. Despite their large populations nationally, German and Irish ancestries don't appear among the most concentrated—they're too successful at spreading across the American landscape to create these extreme local concentrations. The monoculture enclaves belong to groups that, for whatever combination of economic, cultural, and historical reasons, found particular places and stayed.

## The Stories Behind the Statistics

The most remarkable finding isn't just that these enclaves exist, but how extreme they are. A 67.9% ancestry concentration means that roughly two out of every three people you meet on the street share the same ancestral origin. These aren't just statistical anomalies—they're functioning communities where cultural preservation happened not by accident but by design.

Consider **McIntosh County's** German community. This isn't a retirement destination where elderly immigrants chose to settle. This is a place where multiple generations of German-Americans chose to stay, build businesses, maintain institutions, and create a cultural critical mass that continues to attract and retain German-American families. The 1,884 Germans in McIntosh County represent not just individual family choices but a collective cultural project spanning from the 19th-century homestead era to today.

The average concentration across these enclaves is 54.4%—meaning that in these most concentrated counties, roughly one in two residents shares the same ancestral heritage. The median ancestry population is 2,147 people, large enough to support cultural institutions but small enough to maintain tight community bonds.

These monoculture enclaves represent something increasingly rare in American geography: places where cultural heritage isn't just remembered but lived, where ancestry isn't just a census category but a organizing principle of community life. They are the unexpected champions of cultural persistence in a nation built on the promise of reinvention.

In the end, America's monoculture coast reveals that beneath our national narrative of diversity lies a hidden geography of concentration—places where the melting pot never quite melted, creating islands of cultural homogeneity that tell the deeper story of how immigrants didn't just come to America, but created lasting, distinctive American places.

*Data note: Analysis based on 2018-2022 American Community Survey 5-year estimates, table B04006 (People Reporting Ancestry). This table captures ancestral heritage identification and differs from race/ethnicity data collected through dedicated Hispanic origin and Asian race questions. Major groups like Mexican, Chinese, Korean, etc. are not included because they are captured through other Census questions. Counties with fewer than 1,000 total ancestry responses were excluded to ensure statistical reliability.*
